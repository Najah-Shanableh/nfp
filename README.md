Several Data Science for Social Good (http://dssg.io) fellows have been tasked with evaluating the effectiveness of 
the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP), a home-visitation program that pairs a nurse with an at-risk first-time mother for 
the duration of her pregnancy and the first two years of her child's life.  Numerous studies have documented NFP's 
positive benefits for the mothers, children, and society, including three randomized controlled trials (RCT).  However,
most of those studies focus on a single state or locality, and the cost of conducting an RCT at the national level
may be prohibitive.  DSSG is helping NFP address these shortcomings by looking at the program nationally and by 
providing the best evidence possible from an observational study.
