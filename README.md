Nurse Family Partnership Impact Evaluation
===
 
Introduction
 
As part of the Data Science for Social Good Fellowship (http://dssg.io), we have been tasked with evaluating the effectiveness of 
the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP), a home-visitation program that pairs a nurse with an at-risk first-time mother for 
the duration of her pregnancy and the first two years of her child's life.  Numerous studies have documented NFP's 
positive benefits for the mothers, children, and society, including three randomized controlled trials (RCT).  However,
most of those studies focus on a single state or locality, and NFP has been scaled to a national effort operating in diverse communities.  
The cost of conducting an RCT at the national level may be prohibitive.  

DSSG is comparing administrative data from NFP to several public national datasets.  Our goal is to identify women who are similar on all 
observable characteristics (such as demographics) in the two datasets and to compare outcomes between NFP participants and nonparticipants.  
(Although we cannot know that the women in our comparison group did not participate in NFP, the assumption that they are nonparticipants 
will only bias our results in a downward direction, making it less likely that we find impact.)

Our project has three goals:

1) To provide a rough evaluation of NFP's impact at a national level (although this will not be a rigorous program evaluation, it will provide
an educated estimate of NFP's effectiveness)

2) To develop a methodology for basic impact evaluation of nonprofit programs where resource limitations and program size make traditional
experimental evaluations impractical or impossible

3) To explore correlations in NFP's data between outcomes and other characteristics of the mothers, with the goal of helping NFP identify high-risk 
situations and techniques that seem to reduce those risks.  This knowledge will inform NFP's ongoing quality improvement processes.


Methodology

Our intention is to conduct an impact evaluation using propensity score matching.
