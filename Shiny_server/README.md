# Nurse Family Partnership Immunization Study 

## Shiny Server

At the beginning of the fellowship, we met local NFP nurses to learn about their experiences and to gain insight into the program.  We learned that one of their tedious tasks involves calculating how many visits they need to make for each client before she gives birth based on the week of her pregnancy.  NFP calls for a visit every week for the first four weeks a woman is enrolled and a visit every other week after that, and at a minimum the nurses need to make 80% of those recommended visits.  

To address this problem, we created a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.org/) application that does the calculation for the nurses, and thanks to the generosity of RStudio, we host it at http://spark.rstudio.com/jtwalsh0/NFP/.  

There are two working files in this directory.  The first, server.R, does ___.  The second, ui.R, generates the user interface.
